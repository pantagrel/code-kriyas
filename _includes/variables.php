		Scintillus is a work in progress. We aim to cultivate a creative community for people who want to make compelling and beautiful work on small scales. We are interested in low- or no-budget enterprises, being out and about, and the nebulous realm where ideas, emotions and the singular beauty of the physical world converge. We like animated conversation with well-informed people.
		</p><p>
		We want independence from routine and the freedom to act naturally. We want to reduce and reuse before we recycle. We want to celebrate in our way, however we can, the dazzling weirdness in the spectrum of life, from black holes to mascara.
		</p><p>
		We are ambitious, we are curious. We believe that perfection is a difficult myth and no person is entirely what they seem. We like our space. We aren’t exclusive. We love earnestness and geeky devotion to the good idea. We strive for balance.

		Yeah, it’s a story. Parts are real, other parts are more real. I don’t know which is which. I’m just trying something. There’s a space, unexplored, between paper and website and movie and it calls to me. I’m poking around. Maybe this is silly, maybe this is awesome. Maybe it’s both. 
		</p><p>
		Like I said: I’m just trying something. This is me, putting the tests out there. Practicing the notion that done is better than perfect. Because I think the notion of perfection is a lie…and yet, for me, a powerful master. 
		</p><p>
		Right now this whole thing is just digital. But soon there will be physical versions. Bound books, video-filled USB sticks, who knows.
		</p><p>
		What are you trying? I’d like to know.

		This thing is a story thing. Like a combinatorial garden or something.

		It is set on Ballard Island, which is in the Salish Sea. Which is in the Pacific Northwest. Which is only the best place on this entire planet, if anyone's asking.
		</p><p>
		Ballard Workshop is me and a few other special people. But mostly me. Who is me? I'm Kristin. I'm tall. I like computers. I like walking around. I believe that perfection is a difficult myth. 
		</p><p>
		I am also not so much a real-life-helper person. Not a someone who will help you actualize your dreams or conquer your fears. Not directly, anyway. I like these types of people very much and look frequently to them for ideas and comfort. 
		</p><p>
		That type of work, however, is not the work I need to do.
		</p><p>
		I have be come to the happy, terrifying realization that I will not be happy unless I am making things up and pretending those things are real. Rather, I will not be happy unless I am making things from inside me become real things outside me.
