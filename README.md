#Code Kriyas
Abstract: _Wherein I undertake an attempt to reinstate my on-the-side academic trainings with an intentional focus on narrative and visual explorations and completed with the practicing spirit of a yogic kriya._

A __kriya__ is the notion of performing a specific, defined activity with the express purpose of elevating one's being. 

It's about adding *intentionality* to practices. 

Can learning to code make one a better spriritual being? I don't know. I don't see why not.

Therefore, I'm doing a kriyas practice and instead of using breathing or physical poses as is typically done in this yogic tradition, I'm going to write some code snippets. __CODE KRIYAS__. (And I'll continue with my regular yoga practice, as I think that will enhance any learnings done at the monitor. FYI.)

Part of what will make this a kriya is the discipline involved with engagement. It needs to be done daily. Version 0.0.1 is set for a daily practice of 28 days. Every day for the entire month of February. The red month on the calendar. 

I will try to commit something every day, starting with February 4. Feb 1 - 3 was setup and orientation time.


##Here's what's going to happen.
This project is about defining for myself a set of tasks that I'd like to accomplish. I'll do this as I go, because I think this will faciilitate a more organic and engaged learning process. 

I'm going to record what I learn, both informationally and practically, in a markdown file or wiki (this thing you're reading right here) and in HTML/CSS/javascript documents. The single emphasis for 0.0.1 of the Code Kriyas project is on [createjs javascript library](http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS). Bringing back the champagne-joy of Flash fun, but now with full browser integration.

0.0.1 is called __sketches-kriyas__ because that's just what I named it. 
0.0.2 might be called something entirely different, but I don't know yet.


##Current Knowledge
I used to dabble in Flash. __Extra credit:__ The whole reason I currently work in the graphic design field is because when I was about 20 I wanted to make little animated movies. A college acquaintance gave me a copy of Flash 5, which I fully dove into. Cue extended digital learning montage including absurd Photoshop experiments and some real video editing. And...scene. Here we are today.

It still makes me sad that no one uses Flash anymore. I know why, I get it, but it's a lovely program with a lot of cool capabilities. So from my Flash experience and other general computer work, I have:

* Itermediate ActionScript 2.0
* Beginner ActionScript 3.0
* Beginner (but reasonably well-rounded) Python skillz
* Intermediate HTML/CSS


##Want-to-Learn
In a nutshell, javascript.

In a bigger nutshell, bigger than this single set of code kriyas, how to make cool visual story-experiences for the interweb. 


##Wiki
See [the wiki](https://github.com/pantagrel/sketches-kriya/wiki) for this project to get more detail about my goals and what I end up learning.
