##Code Kriyas
Abstract: _Wherein I undertake an attempt to reinstate my on-the-side academic trainings with an intentional focus on narrative and visual explorations and completed with the practicing spirit of a yogic kriya._

A __kriya__ in the yogic sense is the notion of performing a specific, defined activity with the goal of enabling better connection to vibrations of the Universe. It's about adding *intentionality* to practices. It's practicing for a hyper-conscious state of flow.

Can learning to code help with this? Can practicing code be like practicing mantra? I don't see why not.

Part of what will make this a kriya is the discipline involved with engagement. It needs to be done often. Daily, really, but I'm going to start with often. The goal for version 0.0.1 is to engage with a daily coding practice for 40 days. 

Version 0.0.2 will, perhaps, be a daily practice of 120 days. Changing my electromagnetic field through practice.  

Verson 1.0 may be a practice of 1000 days. But that's down the road a bit.

The daily practice of coding is more than typing words into text editors. It's also thinking about coding, or setting up a better workflow, or organizing ones goals on a sheet of paper. To me, it's also about building something that looks good, so I include design within the scope of the kriya practice. I will try to commit something every day. 


###Here's what's going to happen.
This project is about defining for myself a set of tasks that I'd like to accomplish. I'll do this as I go, because I think this will faciilitate a more organic and engaged learning process. 

I'm going to record what I learn, both informationally and practically, in a markdown file (this very file you're reading now) and in HTML/CSS/javascript documents. The current emphasis for 0.0.1 of the Code Kriyas project is on expanding my basic javascript and php skills. I'm looking at browsers and how to connect with them directly. 

###How Will I Measure Progress?
My website [Ballard Workshop] (http://ballardworkshop.com) will be a catalog of what I learn. Hopefully there will be some evidence of progress in the experiments I post. 


__Here's some blow-by-blow details of what I'm learning:__

  1. The website itself focuses on easy-to-access shell for experiemnts. Supports small devices by being more touch friendly as a small size. 
    + PHP modularization is upcoming. I'll set up includes files for better maintainability. 
    + I'd like to set up a dynamic array structure that pulls all the files in the code kriyas folder and arranges them by date created. Then I want to use that array to drive 'next' and 'previous' buttons so users can easily scroll through all the experiements instead of having to go back to the index to navigate.
  1. 'Circles' worked on using a shape library, HTML5 canvas element.
  1. 'Circle Moving' extends knowledge of shape library and canvas elements by adding a 'tick' which enables animation.
