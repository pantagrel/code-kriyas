##Code Kriyas
Abstract: _Wherein I undertake an attempt to reinstate my on-the-side academic trainings with an intentional focus on narrative and visual explorations and completed with the practicing spirit of a yogic kriya._

A __kriya__ is the notion of performing a specific, defined activity with the goal of enabling better connection to vibrations of the Universe. It's about adding *intentionality* to practices. It's practicing for a hyper-conscious state of flow.

Can learning to code help with this? Can practicing code be like practicing mantra? I don't know. I don't see why not.

Part of what will make this a kriya is the discipline involved with engagement. It needs to be done daily. Version 0.0.1 is set for a daily practice of 40 days. 

Version 0.0.2 will, perhaps, be a daily practice of 120 days. Changing my electromagnetic field through practice.  

Verson 1.0 may be a practice of 1000 days. But that's down the road a bit.

Sometimes part of coding is thinking about coding, or setting up a better workflow, or organizing ones goals on a sheet of paper. However, I will try to commit something every day. 


###Here's what's going to happen.
This project is about defining for myself a set of tasks that I'd like to accomplish. I'll do this as I go, because I think this will faciilitate a more organic and engaged learning process. 

I'm going to record what I learn, both informationally and practically, in a markdown file (this very file you're reading now) or a related [wiki](https://github.com/pantagrel/ballardworkshop/wiki) and in HTML/CSS/javascript documents. The single emphasis for 0.0.1 of the Code Kriyas project is on [createjs javascript library](http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS). Bringing back the champagne-joy of Flash fun, but now with full browser integration. 

Like incorporating other mantra into ones practice, other libraries can be used in a practice like this, but not just yet. More focused practice right now on createjs only. 



###Current Knowledge

* Itermediate ActionScript 2.0
* Beginner ActionScript 3.0
* Beginner (but reasonably well-rounded) Python skillz
* Intermediate HTML/CSS


###Want-to-Learn
In a nutshell, javascript.

In a bigger nutshell, bigger than this single set of code kriyas, how to make cool visual story-experiences for the interweb. 


###Wiki
See [the wiki](https://github.com/pantagrel/ballardworkshop/wiki) for this project to get more detail about my goals and what I end up learning.
