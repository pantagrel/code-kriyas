#CHANGE LOG

1. __6.22.14__ Dusted the cobwebs off the github page. Reconfigured and renamed the repo to be more tightly defined than before. Fussed with styling of the user-facing site. Tweaked the github readme content to have more accurate info.

1. __6.23.14__ Delving again into php. Yesssss! Coding is fun no matter your level. Started using php documentation. Set up php file that returned into my browser the contents of a directory. Using MAMP as my 'server' so I can test php stuff on my local machine.

1. __6.24.14__ Worked on creating "next" and "previous" functionality. Easy enough with use of array and $item-1/$item+1. The harder part seems like it will be attaching js animations to the links (the 'flag' which I've seen on other sites that pops out with the name of the page you're going to. looks groovy.) 

1. __6.25.14__ Moved the php practice I've been doing into the index file. Converted all the files to .php. Removed the live site from the interwebs so I can focus on this work without worrying about how boring my live site looks.

1. __6.26.14__ Found a [php function] (http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php) that finds and replaces string[bits] within arrays. I like the php documentation. Also like the "needle" in a "haystack" analogy they use for array examples. Was tired from drinking too much the night before.

1. __6.27.14__ Looked at fonts, created change log and backfilled the entries. Fonts finding: attempted to do it calmly and with direction b/c this type of activity (selecting fonts, colors, etc) can be overwhelming. Easy to get diverted towards unplanned directions. Helps to identify a driving ethos. "Funky interior shapes, slightly irregular as relates to the overall shape. Chunky sans serif? Upper and lower case. Readable, friendly, a bit organic."
